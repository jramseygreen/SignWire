# SignWire - An implementation of a decentralised management protocol for pervasive displays

This is the implementation for my dissertation project at university. A [demo video]https://github.com/jramseygreen/SignWire/blob/master/demo/VID_20210430_090740.mp4) and the [poster](https://github.com/jramseygreen/SignWire/blob/master/demo/956213.pdf) from the project fair are available [here](https://github.com/jramseygreen/SignWire/tree/master/demo).

## How to Use
Simply use either **run.bat** or **run.sh** to start the program and link into the network of displays.
